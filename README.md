Simple Script To Download Your Favorite Manga

The script was created to download Dragon Ball Manga from www.mangafox.me but can also work on other sites with minor modifications.

Version-1:
  This script downloads the manga whose url is provided by the user.
  It also demands Volume number, Chapter number and Starting page count for the images.(Not very Useful)
  
Version-2:
  This script reads a file provided by the user which contains url's of the manga needed to be scraped.
  
Version-3:
  This script is completely automated, it is designed to download the complete 'Dragon Ball series', but if you want any other series just edit the url in the script.
